Game Rules:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player X always goes first.
Players take turns to mark a cell in the grid with their symbol (X or O).
The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.
Use the "Restart Game" button to start a new game at any time.
